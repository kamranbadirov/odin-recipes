This is the first project of the Foundation course of The Odin Project. Currently I have gone through Introfuction, Prerequisite, Git Basics, HTML foundation sections of the course. 

In this project the main goal is to exercise HTML skills that have been covered. The initial look of the website looks a bit brutalist, but in the future iterations it is planned to add new features.
