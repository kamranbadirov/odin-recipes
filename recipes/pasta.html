    <h3>How to Make Shrimp Scampi Pasta</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>· Prep ahead</strong> Have all of your ingredients prepared and
      ready to cook before heating your skillet. You don't want to have to pause
      to cut, chop, squeeze, or measure right in the middle of a fast-moving
      recipe. If you use fresh shrimp, you can peel and devein the shrimp
      earlier in the day, then keep it chilled in the refrigerator until you're
      ready to get cooking.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>· Cook the pasta first:</strong> Boil the pasta in well-salted
      water, drain, and hold aside before cooking the shrimp scampi. You'll add
      the pasta to the hot skillet to warm it before serving. Time your cooking
      so you're ready to start cooking the shrimp immediately after the pasta is
      drained; you don't want the pasta to sit for too long.
    </p>
    <p>
      ·<strong>Don't overcook the shrimp:</strong> It takes just a couple of
      minutes to cook raw shrimp, and if they cook for too long, shrimp turn
      tough and rubbery. You'll know the shrimp are close to done when they
      start to curl into a C shape and turn from translucent gray to opaque pink
      and white.
