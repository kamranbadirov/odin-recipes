      Super crunchy on the outside and fluffy in the middle, these Crispy Roast
      Potatoes with Rosemary and Garlic are the ultimate side dish for any
      occasion. If a French fry and a mashed potato were to have a love child,
      this would be it. They’re very easy to make, require only a few
      ingredients and happen to be Whole3o compliant.

    <h1>The Secret To Perfectly Crispy Roast Potatoes</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The main thing that sets these potatoes apart from regular roasted spuds
        is the fact that they’re parboiled first. This completely transforms the
        texture, breaks down the edges so that they form tiny nooks and
        crannies, and results in an unbelievably crispy crust as they roast.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat a large roasting tray in the oven so that it’s ready by the time
        the potatoes are parboiled.
      </li>
      <li>
        After the initial boil, drain the potatoes and allow them to dry fully
        so that they don’t steam in the roasting pan. For more crispy bits, give
        the potatoes a gentle shake and toss in the colander to rough up the
        edges.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the potatoes are fully dried and roughed up, add the duck fat to
        the preheated roasting pan and let it get hot. This will give the
        potatoes a head start on the browning process. Carefully add the
        potatoes to the hot oil and gently toss them to coat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the potatoes into the hot oven and roast them for anywhere between
        50 and 60 minutes, depending on their size.
      </li>
      <li>
        Just before they’re finished cooking, add the rosemary and garlic
        mixture and toss them to coat. Finish them off with a small pinch of
        flakey sea salt and serve them with your favourite main course.
      </li>
