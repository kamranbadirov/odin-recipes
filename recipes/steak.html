    <h3>Here is how to make a perfect Steak!</h3>
    <p>
      There are many factors that might affect the end result, however we are
      going to focus on the main ones, as the details can be optimizated
      endlessly, and besides as someone smart said "perfect is the enemy of
      good". So here we go.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a perfect steak you have to first make sure you have really good
      ingridients. In our case it is the meat. My personal favorite is ribeye,
      you do you. But make sure you are buying at least AAA graded beef if you
      want to eat a super delicious steak. Make sure your steak have enough
      marbling for especiually juicy and delicious texture..(ahh mnouth
      watering..)
    </p>
    <p>Second comes timing. Nothing can screw your beautiful steak more than</p>
    <p>
      Last but not least, salt is as important, if not more important, as fire.
      Don't be shy to salt your steak generously. Most of it will fall anyway.

    <h1>How to Grill Ribeye Steaks</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring steaks to room temperature and season per the recipe below.</li>
      <li>
        Heat grill to medium heat. Season steaks and grill them between 5 to 7
        minutes on each side, depending on the desired done-ness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove steaks, dot them with butter, and allow them to rest about 5 to
        10 minutes before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Oven Method</h1>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven and cast iron skillet or ovenproof pan per the recipe
        below.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sear the seasoned ribeye steaks for two minutes per side. Once steaks
        are browned on both sides, place the pan in the oven and roast according
        to the recipe instructions below until you reach the desired doneness.
        Do not overcook.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove pan and place cooked steaks on a plate and add butter pats to
        each piece. Make a foil tent and let the steaks “rest” about 5 to 10
        minutes. Resting is important to keep them juicy!
