    <h3>Here is how to make a perfect Steak!</h3>
    <p>
      There are many factors that might affect the end result, however we are
      going to focus on the main ones, as the details can be optimizated
      endlessly, and besides as someone smart said "perfect is the enemy of
      good". So here we go.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a perfect steak you have to first make sure you have really good
      ingridients. In our case it is the meat. My personal favorite is ribeye,
      you do you. But make sure you are buying at least AAA graded beef if you
      want to eat a super delicious steak. Make sure your steak have enough
      marbling for especiually juicy and delicious texture..(ahh mnouth
      watering..)
    </p>
    <p>Second comes timing. Nothing can screw your beautiful steak more than</p>
    <p>
      Last but not least, salt is as important, if not more important, as fire.
      Don't be shy to salt your steak generously. Most of it will fall anyway.
